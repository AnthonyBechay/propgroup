# PropGroup Deployment - Clean Setup

## ✅ Current Working Setup

Your deployment is now working with Vercel treating `apps/web` as the root directory. This is actually a **clean and common approach** for Next.js monorepos.

### Why This Setup is Fine:
1. **Vercel optimizes for Next.js** - It knows how to handle monorepos
2. **Simpler deployment** - No complex root-level orchestration
3. **Faster builds** - Vercel caches dependencies properly
4. **Standard practice** - Many production monorepos use this structure

## 🧹 Cleanup Done

### Removed Resend (Not Needed)
- Supabase handles ALL authentication emails automatically:
  - ✅ Signup confirmation
  - ✅ Password reset  
  - ✅ Magic links
  - ✅ Email verification

### Updated Contact Form
- Now just logs submissions (no email dependency)
- You can save to Supabase database instead if needed

## 📦 To Complete the Cleanup

Run these commands to remove Resend packages:
```bash
cd apps/web
npm uninstall resend @react-email/render
npm install
cd ../..
git add .
git commit -m "Remove Resend - using Supabase for auth emails"
git push
```

## 🔐 Environment Variables

You can now remove from Vercel:
- ❌ `RESEND_API_KEY` - Not needed anymore

Keep these:
- ✅ `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- ✅ `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`  
- ✅ `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`

## 📧 Supabase Email Configuration

To customize auth emails in Supabase:
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard
2. Authentication → Email Templates
3. Customize the templates as needed
4. Supabase sends emails automatically

## 🏗️ Your Current Structure

```
propgroup/
├── apps/
│   └── web/            ← Vercel treats this as root
│       ├── .next/      ← Build output
│       ├── src/        ← Your app code
│       └── vercel.json ← Deployment config
└── packages/           ← Built when needed
    ├── config/
    ├── db/
    └── ui/
```

This is clean and maintainable. No need to change it.

## 🚀 Future Deployments

Just push to git:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "your changes"
git push
```

Vercel will automatically:
1. Install dependencies
2. Build packages
3. Build Next.js app
4. Deploy

## ✨ You're All Set!

Your deployment is:
- ✅ Working
- ✅ Clean
- ✅ Simple
- ✅ Using Supabase for auth (no extra dependencies)
- ✅ Ready for production

No further changes needed. This setup will serve you well.
