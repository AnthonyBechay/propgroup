## Recommendations for Enhancement

### High Priority:

   - `/faq` - Frequently asked questions
   - `/privacy` - Privacy policy
   - `/terms` - Terms of service
   - `/cookies` - Cookie policy

3. **Social Media Links:** Update footer social links with actual URLs

### Medium Priority:
1. **Add Meta Tags:** Ensure all pages have proper SEO meta tags

2. **Add Loading Skeleton:** For featured properties section instead of simple text

3. **Implement Search:** Make traditional search form fully functional

4. **Error Boundaries:** Add error boundaries for better error handling

### Low Priority:
1. **Add Animations:** More micro-interactions on scroll
