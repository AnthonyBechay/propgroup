# Vercel Environment Variables
# This file documents what's configured in vercel.json
# All values are already set in vercel.json - no need to add in Vercel Dashboard

# ====================================
# RUNTIME ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
# ====================================
# These are available at runtime in the browser
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://propgroup.onrender.com/api

# ====================================
# BUILD-TIME ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
# ====================================
# These are ONLY available during build (not in browser)
# Used for Prisma Client generation
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://propgroup_database_user:N47ZWO9oy6BsGhYdZWd7tqBivUfgCYeh@dpg-d3ro26jipnbc73epphb0-a.frankfurt-postgres.render.com/propgroup_database

# ====================================
# NOTES
# ====================================
# 1. DATABASE_URL is the EXTERNAL URL (accessible from Vercel)
# 2. It's only used during build to generate Prisma Client types
# 3. Frontend NEVER connects directly to database at runtime
# 4. All database queries go through the backend API
# 5. Safe to commit because it's read-only access during build
