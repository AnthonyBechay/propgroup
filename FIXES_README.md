# PropGroup - Issues Fixed

## ‚úÖ Fixed Issues

### 1. Dialog Transparent Background Issue
**Problem**: Login and register popups had transparent backgrounds preventing users from typing.

**Solution**: 
- Updated `dialog.tsx` component to use explicit background colors (`bg-white dark:bg-gray-900`)
- Enhanced overlay with stronger opacity (`bg-black/80`) and backdrop blur
- This ensures proper contrast and readability

### 2. Supabase Email Validation URL Routing to Localhost
**Problem**: Confirmation emails were redirecting to localhost instead of production URL.

**Solution**: Created deployment configuration guide. You need to:

#### In Vercel Dashboard:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://your-domain.vercel.app
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-production-anon-key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-production-service-role-key
DATABASE_URL=your-production-database-url
```

#### In Supabase Dashboard:
1. Go to **Authentication ‚Üí URL Configuration**
2. Set **Site URL**: `https://your-domain.vercel.app`
3. Add **Redirect URLs**:
   - `https://your-domain.vercel.app/auth/callback`
   - `https://your-domain.vercel.app`
   - `http://localhost:3000/auth/callback` (for development)

### 3. UI Performance Optimization
**Problem**: UI was slow/buggy with heavy animations.

**Solutions Implemented**:
- **Reduced animation complexity**: Simplified gradients, reduced colors in animated backgrounds
- **Optimized transform animations**: Using `transform3d()` for GPU acceleration
- **Reduced blur effects**: From `blur(20px)` to `blur(10px)` for better performance
- **Added `will-change` properties**: For elements that will animate
- **Shortened transition durations**: From 300-500ms to 200-250ms
- **Created PerformanceWrapper component**: Detects low-end devices and reduces animations
- **Optimized blob animations**: Longer duration (10s) and simpler transforms

### 4. Enhanced Admin Property Management
**Problem**: Admin needed more comprehensive property management.

**Solutions Implemented**:
- ‚úÖ Property creation modal with all details
- ‚úÖ Added fields for:
  - Property type (Apartment, Villa, etc.)
  - Location details
  - Amenities
  - Nearby facilities
  - Payment plans
  - Completion dates
  - Investment data (ROI, rental yield, capital growth)
- ‚úÖ Image URL management system
- ‚úÖ Golden Visa eligibility flag
- ‚úÖ Developer and location guide associations

## üìù Deployment Checklist

### Before Deployment:
- [ ] Update all environment variables in Vercel
- [ ] Configure Supabase Auth URLs
- [ ] Test email validation flow locally
- [ ] Verify database migrations are complete

### After Deployment:
- [ ] Test email confirmation flow
- [ ] Verify all dialogs work properly
- [ ] Check animation performance on mobile
- [ ] Test admin property creation

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Local Development**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Deploy to Vercel**:
   - Push to GitHub
   - Import in Vercel
   - Add environment variables
   - Deploy

3. **Configure Supabase**:
   - Update Auth settings
   - Set production URLs
   - Test email flow

## üîß Performance Tips

- The app now detects device capabilities and reduces animations on low-end devices
- Users with "prefers-reduced-motion" will see minimal animations
- Glass morphism effects are optimized for better performance
- All major animations use GPU acceleration

## üì± Browser Support

- Chrome/Edge: Full support
- Firefox: Full support  
- Safari: Full support (with -webkit prefixes)
- Mobile browsers: Optimized for performance

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### If dialogs are still transparent:
- Clear browser cache
- Check if CSS is loading properly
- Verify dark mode settings

### If emails still go to localhost:
- Double-check Supabase Auth settings
- Verify NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL in Vercel
- Check email template settings in Supabase

### If animations are still slow:
- Enable hardware acceleration in browser
- Check device performance metrics
- Consider disabling animations on very low-end devices

## üìû Support
