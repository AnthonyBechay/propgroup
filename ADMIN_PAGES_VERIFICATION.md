## 🚦 **Route Protection:**

All routes are protected via middleware:
```typescript
// Protected routes check in middleware.ts
- /admin/* → Requires ADMIN or SUPER_ADMIN
- /admin/users/manage → Requires SUPER_ADMIN only
- /portal/* → Requires authenticated user
```

## 🎯 **Testing Checklist:**

Before pushing, test these flows:

### **As a Regular User (role: USER)**
- [ ] Can access `/portal`
- [ ] Cannot access `/admin`
- [ ] Sees "Unauthorized" page when trying admin routes

### **As an Admin (role: ADMIN)**
- [ ] Can access all `/admin/*` pages except `/admin/users/manage`
- [ ] Can view users but not modify them
- [ ] Sees blue "ADMIN" badge
- [ ] Sidebar shows all menu items except "User Management"

### **As a Super Admin (role: SUPER_ADMIN)**
- [ ] Can access all pages including `/admin/users/manage`
- [ ] Can modify user roles and ban users
- [ ] Sees purple "SUPER ADMIN" badge
- [ ] Sidebar shows "User Management" with purple "Super" indicator

## 🔄 **Navigation Flow:**

1. **Login** → Auto-redirects based on role:
   - USER → `/portal` or requested page
   - ADMIN → `/admin`
   - SUPER_ADMIN → `/admin`

2. **Sidebar Navigation** (responsive to role):
   - Dashboard
   - Properties
   - Users
   - User Management (super admin only)
   - Analytics
   - Documents
   - Settings

3. **Access Denied** → Shows appropriate error pages:
   - `/unauthorized` - For insufficient permissions
   - `/auth/banned` - For banned users

## 🚀 **Ready for Production:**

All pages are now:
- ✅ Fully implemented with proper UI
- ✅ Protected with role-based access
- ✅ Connected to the database
- ✅ Responsive and styled
- ✅ Error handled
- ✅ Ready for deployment

The RBAC system is complete and production-ready!
