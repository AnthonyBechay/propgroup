# Prisma Build Error Fix - Summary

## Problem Fixed
The Vercel deployment was failing with the error:
```
Module not found: Can't resolve './generated'
```

This was happening because the Prisma client was being generated in a custom location (`src/generated`) but the compiled JavaScript was looking for it in a different location.

## Solution Applied

1. **Updated Prisma Configuration**: Removed the custom output path from `packages/db/prisma/schema.prisma` to use the default location (`node_modules/@prisma/client`)

2. **Updated Import Statements**: Changed the import in `packages/db/src/index.ts` from `'./generated'` to `'@prisma/client'` (the standard Prisma approach)

3. **Rebuilt Distribution Files**: Updated the compiled JavaScript files in `packages/db/dist/` to use the correct imports

4. **Cleaned Up**: Moved the old generated folder to `_old_files` as backup

## Next Steps for Deployment

1. **Test Locally First** (Optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   # Run the local build test
   test-local-build.bat
   ```

2. **Deploy to Vercel**:
   ```bash
   # Deploy to production
   vercel --prod
   
   # Or deploy to preview
   vercel
   ```

3. **Ensure Environment Variables**: Make sure all required environment variables are set in your Vercel dashboard:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
   - `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
   - `DATABASE_URL` (if using external PostgreSQL)

## What Changed
- `packages/db/prisma/schema.prisma` - Removed custom output path
- `packages/db/src/index.ts` - Changed import to use `@prisma/client`
- `packages/db/dist/index.js` - Updated compiled JavaScript
- `packages/db/dist/index.d.ts` - Updated TypeScript declarations

## Backup
The old generated Prisma files have been backed up to:
`_old_files/generated_prisma_backup/`

## Notes
- The build process already handles Prisma client generation automatically
- No changes were needed to the Vercel build scripts
- The fix uses the standard Prisma approach which is more compatible with deployment platforms
